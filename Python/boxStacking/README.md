Usage is very simple. 
   
The only file submitted is boxStacking.py and this README.    
This is all you need! Output will be in outfile.txt     

Run     
python boxStacking.py [INFILE]    
where [INFILE] is the location of your infile. The output will be in outfile.txt   


See comments and documentation in the code.
